## Use of AI Tools in This Project

As part of the development of this project, I used **ChatGPT** by OpenAI as an assistance tool. ChatGPT was used for the following purposes:

- **Brainstorming ideas**   
- **Clarifying concepts** 
- **Improving code readability**   
- **Generating  code and fixing bugs**
- **Find similar implementations**

Example prompts:

- **Give three ways to implement this feature**
- **Generate sample user-portfolio.json**
- **Generate code as defined in architecture**
- **Pasting  error logs to find ways to resolve a bug**
- **Explain this concept**
